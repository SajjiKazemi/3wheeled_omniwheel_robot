# A Simple Simulation Environment for a Three-Wheeled Omnidirectional Robot

## Overview

This repository provides a basic implementation of a simulation environment for a three-wheeled omnidirectional robot, which is shown in the following image. The implementation is based on chapter thirteen of the Modern Robotics Book. The simulation environment provides the user with a top view of the robot's trajectory and its orientation in each time step. Additionally, the robot's pose, Î¸, x, y, vs time is plotted. The robot's characteristics as well as the running time can be changed.

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SajjiKazemi/3wheeled_omniwheel_robot.git
```

## Dependencies
Create a virtual environment using the provided robot_env.yml file in the /utils directory:

```bash
conda env create -f robot_env.yml
```
Activate the environment:

```bash
conda activate robot_env
```

## Usage
To use the simulation environment you can use either the main.py file or the notebook.ipynb file.
